<h1>The Drone Identity -- Investigating Forensic-Readiness of U-Space Services</h1>
This <a href="https://www.engagektn.com/">EngageKTN</a> project will investigate <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/50894/">forensic-readiness requirements</a> of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), to help identify causes of safety  and  security  related  air  traffic incidents. It  is  a  collaborative  effort  between researchers at The Open University (OU) and NATS. The  project  will  contribute  to  addressing  the  vulnerabilities  and  global  security  of  communications, navigation, and surveillance systems in air traffic management (CNS/ATM). Security and safety incidents in such `systems of systems' are challenging to investigate, particularly given the diverse digital technologies and human behaviours involved, and the different degrees of automation involved. Unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) are increasingly creating challenges for managing the safety of the aircraft that share the airspace with them. Recent high-profile incidents at airports arising from unidentified drones (such as those at Gatwick and  Heathrow  airport),  underline  the  urgent  need  to  investigate  the  risks  and  incidents  in  such  managed airspaces. 
The collection and use of forensic data associated with drones and surrounding
physical contexts is key to effective investigation.  The  research  will  be
conducted in  the  context  of U-Space,  focusing  on  the  architecture  and
concept  of operations  for  European  unmanned  traffic  management  (UTM),
and  the  ability  to  preserve  such  vital information as evidence for
forensic investigations. 
<!-- The goals of such forensic readiness is to ensure that the root causes of incidents can always be analysed, facilitated by evidence collected during operation (drone flight). The project  will  focus  on  drone  data,  examining  ways  in  which  key  drone  characteristics  can  be  determined  and recorded  soundly,  if  and  when  incidents  involving  the  drone(s)  occur.  In  particular,  the  key  attributes  that characterise and identify the drones, their operators, and their anomalous behaviours will be investigated.  A prototype  demonstrator  will  be  developed, including  a  technical  architecture,  to  illustrate  and  evaluate  the forensic readiness requirements for U-Space services.//-->
